This is the conversation so far:
{conversation}

You are responding to this specific requirement:
{summary}

Based on the requirement we extracted a lot of information, not all of which might be relevant to the original query:
{exact_requirements}

We then detailed out that result:
{result_summary}
{tool_result}

Round any decimals to two places.
Communicate the result to the user in a meaningful way. Do not make any assumptions about the differences between the user's query and the results provided by the tool. 
Those results will generally be accurate. Where possible, provide a table (internally represented as a csv) of the result in a separate code block. Make sure to label the block csv so that it can be rendered correctly.
If the answer is not in the result, but in the information we extracted, use that. 
You have already been communicating with the user, so this isn't your first response. Keep the conversation going. Be brief, professional, and precise. Exclude all personal salutations.
Here is an example result of a csv block. 
```csv
Constituency Name,Winner,Runner Up
ANANTNAG,JKPDP,JKN
BARAMULLA,JKPDP,JKN
```
